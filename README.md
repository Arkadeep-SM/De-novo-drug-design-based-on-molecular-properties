# De-novo-drug-design-based-on-molecular-properties
This project implements a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for generating novel molecules (represented as SELFIES sequences) conditioned on desired molecular properties. The model is designed for de novo molecular design and learns to reconstruct and generate molecular sequences guided by physicochemical properties
